          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Let's be honest: you hate memorizing commands. You despise man pages.
            The very sight of <code>tar -xzvf</code> makes your heart grow three
            sizes smaller.
          </p>

          <p>
            GrinSh is a conversational shell for macOS that couldn't care less
            about your ability to remember arcane flags and cryptic syntax. Just
            tell it what you want in plain English, and it gets to work. No
            studying. No googling "how to find files modified in the last week"
            for the hundredth time. No pretending you remember what
            <code>awk</code> does.
          </p>

          <h3>What It Looks Like</h3>
          <p>Talk to your terminal like a normal human being:</p>
          <pre><code>&gt; what's using port 8080
&gt; compress the projects folder
&gt; find that pdf I downloaded last week
&gt; quit slack</code></pre>

          <p>
            Notice anything? No flags. No pipes. No syntax errors because you
            forgot a semicolon. Just requests in actual English.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="why">
          <h2>Why GrinSh Exists</h2>
          <p>
            Because life is too short to remember whether it's <code>-la</code>
            or <code>-al</code>. Because you have better things to do than
            memorize the seventeen different ways to kill a process. Because the
            year is 2025 and we shouldn't need a PhD to interact with our
            computers.
          </p>

          <p>
            GrinSh knows more than you do, and it's not smug about it. It
            understands context, remembers what you were doing, and figures out
            the right tool for the job. If it doesn't have a tool, it finds one,
            installs it, learns it, and gets on with things.
          </p>

          <p>
            Built with Swift and powered by Claude, GrinSh uses native macOS
            APIs whenever possible and falls back to CLI tools when necessary.
            It's fast, it's smart, and it doesn't make you feel like you're
            taking a Unix certification exam every time you want to compress a
            file.
          </p>

          <h2>What It Does</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Understands Natural Language.</strong> Say what you want.
            Don't worry about syntax, flags, or the "proper" way to phrase
            things. GrinSh figures it out.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Remembers Your Conversation.</strong> Unlike your goldfish
            of a bash prompt, GrinSh maintains context across your session.
            Reference "that folder" or "the file from earlier" and it knows what
            you mean.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Auto-installs Missing Tools.</strong> Need a CLI tool you
            don't have? GrinSh discovers it via Homebrew, installs it, reads its
            documentation, and uses it. All without bothering you.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Uses Touch ID for Privileged Operations.</strong> No more
            typing your password like a caveman. When something needs sudo, you
            get a native macOS authentication prompt.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Gives You an Escape Hatch.</strong> Sometimes you actually
            do want to run a raw command. Prefix it with <code>!</code> and
            GrinSh gets out of your way: <code>!git status</code>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Stays Native.</strong> Built with Swift, using macOS APIs
            for file operations, app management, and system tasks. It's not a
            wrapper around bash scripts held together with duct tape and prayers.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="install">
          <h2>Installation</h2>

          <p>
            Getting GrinSh up and running takes about thirty seconds. Copy this
            line, paste it into your terminal, and let it do its thing:
          </p>

          <pre><code>curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronmaturen/GrinSh/main/install.sh | bash</code></pre>

          <p>
            The installer downloads the latest release, verifies the checksums
            (because we're not monsters), and drops the binary in
            <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.
          </p>

          <h3>What You Need</h3>
          <p>
            Not much. You need macOS 13.0 or later, because we're not supporting
            ancient history. You need a Claude API key from
            <a href="https://console.anthropic.com" target="_blank"
              >console.anthropic.com</a
            >
            (that's what powers the natural language understanding). And you
            probably want Homebrew installed, because that's how GrinSh finds
            and installs CLI tools on demand.
          </p>

          <h3>First Launch</h3>
          <p>
            After installation, drop your Claude API key into
            <code>~/.grinshrc</code> and run <code>grinsh</code>. That's it.
            You're done.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're feeling bold and want to make GrinSh your default shell,
            run <code>chsh -s /usr/local/bin/grinsh</code>. But maybe try it out
            first. We're confident, not reckless.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="how-it-works">
          <h2>How It Works</h2>

          <p>
            The flow is straightforward: you type what you want in plain
            English. Claude interprets your intent and figures out which tool or
            API call will get it done. GrinSh executes it using native Swift
            APIs when possible, or the appropriate CLI tool when necessary.
          </p>

          <p>
            When GrinSh encounters a tool it doesn't have, it doesn't throw an
            error and make you google things. It searches Homebrew, finds the
            package, installs it, pulls down its documentation, learns how to
            use it, and caches that knowledge for next time. All of this happens
            in the background while you're doing literally anything else.
          </p>

          <p>
            The whole system maintains conversation context, so you can say
            things like "compress that" or "move it to the desktop" and GrinSh
            knows what you're referring to. It's almost like talking to someone
            who's paying attention.
          </p>
